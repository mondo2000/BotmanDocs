Introduction

Botman, a server manager for managing a 7 Days to Die server
------------------------------------------------------------

Bot source updated 27 March 2017. Works with A15.2 (b8)

Botman is a server manager that you interact with ingame and/or via Internet Relay Chat rather than in an application window.  A web interface is in the works which will make the bot and server even easier to manage.

Botman is the code name for a Lua script written by Matthew Dwyer aka Smegz0r with help and input from many friends, players and admins.  It is released as open source so that if you have the skill, time and patience you can make it uniquely yours and even contribute cool new features back so that everyone gets a better bot.  Lua is really easy to learn and you can edit it while it is running!  How cool is that?  :D

It can run on low spec hardware or in the cloud.  It is fast, stable and feature rich with many commands for server owners, admins and players.  The bot has a personality and you can mould it how you want
The Windows build of Botman is on hold so that I can concentrate on other tasks.  The bot demands a lot of my time and I give a lot but I have to eat too.  I am still actively working on the bot but in other areas.

Contact me for the latest sources.  I update and maintain all bots that I release.  An estimated over 100 bots so far!  Contact me if you need help setting up a bot and/or a virtual machine for it.
 
Disclaimer:  I support the code that I publish.  Any private modifications to my code are the sole responsibility of the person making those modifications.
I do not support changes designed to require the exchange of real money for items or services using my code.



Hi guys!  I want to build a web interface for the bot. It initially will be simple, just Bootstrap, and coding by hand.  Maybe later I'll have a crack at something fancy like Meteor.  My main problem is time.  If it got any funding, I could put more time and effort into it than I can afford at the moment.  So I'm looking at fundraising for it.  I'm not sure what a realistic funding goal should be.  If I was doing this for a client, I'd be talking $5,000.  If you would like to donate towards the bot having a web interface, head over to my donate page.  I think Paypal lets you leave a message with your donation.  If I get any donations towards the web interface, I'll add one of those cheesy thermometer graphics to this page :)
