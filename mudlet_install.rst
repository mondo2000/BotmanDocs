=======================================

Step 1. Installing Mudlet
-------------------------
  Notes:

  Here is an official help thread for Botman: `https://7daystodie.com/forums <https://7daystodie.com/forums/showthread.php?52933-Botman-server-manager-official-support-thread>`_


  TheFea is working on a modified version for Smegz0r. By far the fastest and easiest way to get Mudlet running right.

  Found here: `https://github.com/itsTheFae/FaesMudlet2 <https://github.com/itsTheFae/FaesMudlet2>`_ read up on it

  1. Download/compile/run Mudlet:
   ``wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsTheFae/FaesMudlet2/master/setup-debian.sh``

   ``chmod +x ./setup-debian.sh && ./setup-debian.sh``

   ``wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsTheFae/FaesMudlet2/master/build-mudlet.sh``

  Note: This last step will take some time to build

   ``chmod +x ./build-mudlet.sh && ./build-mudlet.sh``

  2. Download/Clone Botman
